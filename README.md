1- Best Fit Allocation:
In this algorithm, the memory manager searches for the smallest free partition that can accommodate the incoming process.<br>
It aims to minimize the amount of wasted memory and reduce external fragmentation.<br>
Requires iterating through the entire list of free partitions to find the best fit, which can be slower than other algorithms.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
2- First Fit Allocation:<br>
This algorithm assigns the first free partition that is large enough to hold the incoming process.<br>
It quickly scans the list of free partitions and allocates the first suitable partition it encounters.<br>
May lead to more external fragmentation compared to Best Fit but has a lower time complexity.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
3- Worst Fit Allocation:
In this algorithm, the largest free partition available is selected to accommodate the incoming process.
It aims to optimize the utilization of memory by allocating the largest available space.
Can result in more external fragmentation as smaller free partitions are left unused.

4- Partition Allocation:
Partition allocation refers to the division of memory into fixed-sized or variable-sized partitions to accommodate processes. <br>
Fixed partition allocation assigns specific partitions to processes, while dynamic partition allocation allows for variable-sized partitions.<br>
Fixed partition allocation is simpler but may lead to internal fragmentation if the partition size does not match the process size.<br>
Dynamic partition allocation requires allocation and deallocation algorithms (such as Best Fit, First Fit, or Worst Fit) to find suitable free partitions.<br>
These memory management algorithms play a crucial role in efficient memory allocation and management within an operating system,<br> addressing concerns such as fragmentation and optimal resource utilization. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific system requirements and characteristics of the workload being executed.
